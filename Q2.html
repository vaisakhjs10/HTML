	<h2>Indian men's football team captain Sunil Chhetri became the joint fifth highest goalscorer in international football history.</h2>
	<p1>Sunil Chhetri, India's talismanic captain scripted a new record as he became the joint fifth-highest goal-scorer in international football. During India's clash against Hong Kong in the AFC Asian Cup Qualifier, Chhetri scored his 84th goal and equalled Ferenc Puskas, the Real Madrid player's record. 
    Earlier in October 2021, Chhetri also surpassed legendary football player Pele's record of 77 goals. He is now third on the list of active international goalscorers, just behind Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo and Argentina's Lionel Messi. Currently, Ronaldo is the highest goalscorer in international football with 117 goals, while Messi is in the fourth spot with a total of 86 goals.</p1>
